## plan


    - applications -> curve fitting/regression -> machine learning definitions -> get all to come up and draw GP -> do my own

    -   explain parametric vs non-parametric intuitevely (second definition of Gaussian process)

    -   into gaussian distribution, 2d correlation, 5 d correlation, 50 d correlation, link to their plot - third definition of Gaussian process?

    -   how do we define GP? mean and cov

    -  mean 0, look at different cov functions, see how functions change
    
    -  second level of change - hyperparameters
    
    - optimisation

    - summary of my first GP

    - problems with GPs & advanced approaches


## Why do we care?

- Interested in monitoring an aircraft wing, but only have access to data where we have sensors

- Sensors = cost

## Virtual sensing

- Interested in monitoring an aircraft wing, but only have access to data where we have sensors

- Sensors = cost 

- Use a Gaussian process to act as a "virtual sensor"

## Virtual sensing of different phenomena

- We can extend virtual sensing to using one type of measurement to predict another

- e.g predicting a wind turbine's power output from measured wind speed

## Many other reasons

- Surrogate modelling

- Dealing with complex behaviours

## title

- All revolve around learning a map from $X \rightarrow \mathbf{y}$

- In machine learning & statistics, we call this a regression problem

- We can use Gaussian process (regression) to learn this map!

- Boils down to fitting curves (functions) through data
